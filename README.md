# We Care

"WeCare is a user-friendly website designed to empower citizens by providing a platform to voice their complaints and concerns regarding city streets. The primary focus is on facilitating a seamless process for users to raise issues related to roads, track the progress of their complaints, and, when necessary, escalate matters. External users, representing the common citizens, are encouraged to register on the platform to actively participate in improving their local infrastructure. Meanwhile, internal users, comprising city officers responsible for addressing these concerns, can be created and managed through the Officers Admin page. The website ensures a smooth user experience with a prominently placed logout button at the top right corner, allowing individuals to effortlessly navigate back to the landing page and login screen when needed."
