# We Care

"WeCare is a user-friendly website designed to empower citizens by providing a platform to voice their complaints and concerns regarding city streets. The primary focus is on facilitating a seamless process for users to raise issues related to roads, track the progress of their complaints, and, when necessary, escalate matters. External users, representing the common citizens, are encouraged to register on the platform to actively participate in improving their local infrastructure. Meanwhile, internal users, comprising city officers responsible for addressing these concerns, can be created and managed through the Officers Admin page. The website ensures a smooth user experience with a prominently placed logout button at the top right corner, allowing individuals to effortlessly navigate back to the landing page and login screen when needed."

## Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
DFD is the abbreviation for Data Flow Diagram. The flow of data of a system or a process is represented by DFD. It also gives insight into the inputs and outputs of each entity and the process itself. DFD does not have control flow and no loops or decision rules are present. Specific operations depending on the type of data can be explained by a flowchart.

## Class Diagram
A class diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects. A class diagram is used to visualize, describe, document various different aspects of the system, and also construct executable software code.

## Wireframes
A wireframe is a visual representation of what users will see and interact with when they land on a website, web page, or mobile app. The purpose of a wireframe is to finalize a user-experience (UX) concept before actually coding a website or app.
